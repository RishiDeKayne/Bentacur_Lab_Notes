# Bentacur_Lab_Notes

1. Gene depth coverage/CNV
    -1.1 for each species get a bed file containing the chromosome, start bp and end bp for each single copy busco and each focal gene  
    -1.2 for each species map WGS data to the corresponding assembly  
    -1.3 calculate mean coverage across genome in sliding windows so we can extract mean coverage across single copy buscos and then each focal gene  
    
2. Repeat characterisation of each species  
    -2.1 make repeat library from own genome  
    -2.2 get repeat library from database(s)  
    -2.3 combine  
    -2.4 get repeat content of each genome  

3. Kmer distributions for each species
