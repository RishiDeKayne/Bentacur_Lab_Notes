#commands to calculate TE content of sequencing data

#software required: RepeatModeler (I used .v2.0.1), RepeatMasker (I used v-4.1.0), 

################
# 1. make repeat library
################
#to get a repeat library we will use we will combine published/stored repeats from the clade with a de novo repeat library
#this de novo repeat library will be from the one very good genome that you have

#1.1 build repeat library form your assembly - this example command works for RepeatModeler.v2.0.1
#for installing this see: https://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/ 
#this command makes a new database where you just need to specify a `-name` for the library and the path to `your_genome.fa`

BuildDatabase -name your_genome_name_1 -engine ncbi /file/path/to/your_genome.fa

#now you can query this to get the library. The following command will use RepeatScout and RECON and LTRStruct to find repeat categories

RepeatModeler -database your_genome_name_1 -pa 50 -LTRStruct

#here you can also get repeats from a species/clade you specify from existing databases - you can search for different species/clades
#here I give an example with lepidoptera (butterflies) so you should change that to the broadest clade of your fish

perl /path/to/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker-4.1.0/util/queryRepeatDatabase.pl -species Lepidoptera | grep -v "Species:" > Lepidoptera.Repbase.repeatmasker

#count how many repeats you have
grep ">" Lepidoptera.Repbase.repeatmasker  | wc -l

#count how many were in your own repeat library
grep ">" your_genome_name_1-families.fa | wc -l


#combine these to form one big library/database we will use moving forward
cat Lepidoptera.Repbase.repeatmasker your_genome_name_1-families.fa > all.repeatmasker
grep ">" all.repeatmasker | wc -l

# 2. calculate repeat content in genomic data 
################
#these next steps will get repeat content from a fasta file 
#this first example will just extract this information from your good reference, I would see how long this takes and then see if you can do this for the whole raw reads file
#if that were to take too long perhaps you can still run this for each proto-assembly that you have instead (it could be rough but better than nothing).

#copy genome here:
cp your_genome.fa .

#do the repeat masking (which will output proportions for each family)
/ceph/software/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker-4.1.0/RepeatMasker -e rmblast -pa 48 -s -lib all.repeatmasker -dir /file/path/to/our_output -xsmall -gff ./your_genome.fa

#if you want to get repeat landscape to view expansion of gene families - and I would do this for your good reference only:
/path/to/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker-4.1.0/RepeatMasker -e rmblast -pa 48 -s -a -xsmall -gccalc -lib all.repeatmasker ./your_genome.fa

#now calculate the divergence from the .align output file from previous step
#worth looking up what the -noCpGMod option does and seeing if you might need to add this to calculate the repeat landscape here
/path/to/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker-4.1.0/util/calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl -s your_output.divsum Dchry2.2.fa.align

#then plot - here you need to adjust the -g to be your genome length so the %s are calculated properly
/path/to/repeatmasker/RepeatMasker-4.1.0/util/createRepeatLandscape.pl -div your_output.divsum -g 354020300 > your_output.html

#then view the .html for your repeat landscape

#if you write a script to mask each of your references you can then extract the information for each family/group of TEs from each individual with grep
#let me know if you need help with this
