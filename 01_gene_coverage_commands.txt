#commands to calculate coverage across genes

#software required: bwa, samtools, mosdepth (installation: https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth)

#Gene depth coverage/CNV -
#-1.1 for each species get a bed file containing the chromosome, start bp and end bp for each single copy busco and each focal gene
#-1.2 for each species map WGS data to the corresponding assembly
#-1.3 calculate mean coverage across genome in sliding windows so we can extract mean coverage across single copy buscos and then each focal gene

################
# 1.1 extract regions of interest for each species
################
#this will require you to pull out the busco locations for each assembly so you have a file that looks something like:

Busco_or_gene_name  CHROM START END
Busco_1 chr1  100 400
Gene_2 chr4 1010  2500


################
# 1.2 map reads
################
# map raw reads from each individual to your assembly for that species

#first index genome if needed
bwa index /file/path/to/your_genome.fa

#and then do the mapping
#single-end data
bwa mem /file/path/to/your_genome.fa /file/path/to/your_reads_indiv1.fq.gz > /file/path/to/indiv1.sam

# paired-end mapping, general command structure, adjust to your case
bwa mem /file/path/to/your_genome.fa /file/path/to/your_reads_indiv1_read1.fq.gz /file/path/to/your_reads_indiv1_read2.fq.gz > /file/path/to/indiv1.sam

#filter out secondary alignments and covert sam to bam

################
# 1.3 Calculate coverage
################
# take the bam files that result from this mapping and run mosdepth on them which will give coverage of each gene for each individual
# I would start with all together and scroll through the .html file you will get and then you can specify/extract data for each region separately

###assess bams with MOSDEPTH

#get a list of bam files
ls *.bam > bam.list

#now run code to get a single file with all mosdepth commands
touch mosdepth_run.txt
cat bam.list | while read bam
do
echo "mosdepth -n ${bam} /path/to/your/${bam} && touch /path/to/working/directory/done_files/${bam}.done" >> mosdepth_run.txt
done

#use parallel to run this list of commands - you may need to change this command according to your HPC architecture
#it is also possible to run some kind of batch script if you have a different kind of submission system
parallel -j 1 'qsub -cwd -N mosdepth -V -pe smp64 1 -l h=bigbang -b yes {}' :::: mosdepth_run.txt

#now we want to run this mosdepth script whihc will output curves of coverage for each individual across each scaffold - in our case each gene
python ../mosdepth/scripts/plot-dist.py ../*global.dist.txt

#this will make a .html file you can then view

#there should now be lists of .summary* files which should have information about coverage across each scaffold/in our case gene - you can plot these
#to start I would plot a box plot showing the coverage for each gene grouping individuals by ecomorph - you could also do a scatterplot and colour sister species with different ecomorphs, where we expect a transition, the same colour-code

#now you can extract coverage across all buscos and across your genes of interest and plot them
#let me know if I can help with a script for this
