#commands to calculate coverage across genes

#software required: bwa, samtools, mosdepth

################
# 1. Get sequences of genes of interest
################
# get genes in fasta format with the name in the header and then the sequence

################
# 2. map reads
################
# map raw reads from each individual to the fasta file with genes listed


################
# 3. Calculate coverage
################
# take the bam files that result from this mapping and run mosdepth on them which will give coverage of each gene for each individual
# I would start with all together and scroll through the .html file you will get and then you can specify/extract data for each region separately
